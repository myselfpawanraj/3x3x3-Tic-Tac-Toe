# 3x3x3 TTT
This is a 3D tic-tac-toe using the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. It includes a graphical GUI to make it interesting.

Run main.py to play it.

## Rules
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 by 3 by 3 squares.
- You are **X**, your friend (or the computer in this case) is **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally across the face or the cube) is the winner.
- When all 27 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Instructions
- Click an empty box to make your move
- Right Click to restart a game when the game ends.
- Hit SPACE to toggle between modes.

## Tech Used
- **Python** to code the game
- Minimax program is written in **C++** to make it overall faster
- **Pygame** for GUI of the game
- **GIT** for Version Control
